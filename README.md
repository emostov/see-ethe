See-The-Ethe, an Etherscan clone, is a blockchain explorer that provides rich data feeds, and analytics about accounts, miners, contracts and their transactions. A user can label, comment, and track accounts. Stretch features include allowing users to curate contracts, dapps, and dexas that they can prove ownership of and also allow direct interaction with read and write functions of smart contracts.
